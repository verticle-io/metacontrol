MetaControl is a collaborative observability platform for tech teams with complex environments under their responsibility.
It helps them to increase their operational excellence by sharing holistic insights centrally at a simplified, unstandable level.

## Transitioning to opensource 

The project has been around for a couple of years and was used for private projects. 
We (the Verticle team) as the owner of that codebase decided to share a reworked version with the community as we feel the service to be beneficial for everyone. 
We also want the project to thrive and grow and therefore give it the right ecosystem here on Github.

The open source codebase will be developed from scratch. 
Our goal is to rework the basic solution architecture and allow interested parties and users to contribute.
